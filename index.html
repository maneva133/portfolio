            <p>
                Hi, I’m Maja, a passionate and driven FCSE
                (Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering) student with a deep love for coding,
                problem-solving, and tackling new challenges. Technology has always fascinated me, and
                I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions. Whether it’s debugging code,
                designing algorithms, or exploring new technologies, I’m always eager to push my limits and grow as a
                developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond technical skills, I place a strong emphasis on effective communication and collaboration.
                I believe that the best solutions are born from teamwork, and I enjoy working with others to brainstorm
                ideas,
                share knowledge, and achieve common goals. My ability to explain technical concepts in simple terms and
                adapt my
                communication style to different audiences has helped me excel in group projects and presentations.

                <p>
                    <b>Description:</b>
                    The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive and user-friendly full-stack application
                    built to streamline hotel operations, including guest reservations, customer records,
                    and service management. Developed using the Spring Boot framework on the backend and React on the
                    frontend,
                    this application centralizes all essential hotel functions into a single platform.
                    It leverages modern technologies like PostgreSQL for data storage, Docker for containerization,
                    and Kubernetes for orchestration and scalability. The entire system is integrated with a CI/CD
                    pipeline using
                    GitHub Actions to ensure smooth and automated deployments.
                </p>

                    <b>Impact:</b>
                    This solution empowers hotel administrators to efficiently manage day-to-day operations,
                    reduces manual overhead, and enhances the overall guest experience. Its modular architecture and
                    cloud-native setup
                    make it ideal for businesses aiming to embrace digital transformation and scale seamlessly.

                    <b>Description:</b>
                    The User Tracking Time Chrome Extension is a personal productivity tool designed to help users
                    monitor and manage
                    their screen time effectively. Inspired by my own need to reduce excessive computer usage, this
                    extension tracks website activity
                    and visualizes time spent online using interactive charts. Built with JavaScript for the interface,
                    Spring Boot for handling backend logic,
                    and Chart.js for data visualization, it provides users with clear and actionable insights into their
                    browsing habits.
                    The extension encourages users to take regular breaks and build healthier digital routines.

                    <b>Impact:</b>
                    This tool promotes mindful screen usage and supports better time management by making users aware of
                    how their time is spent online.
                    Its clean interface and informative charts turn raw data into useful feedback, making it an ideal
                    companion
                    for students, professionals, or anyone looking to reduce digital distractions and improve
                    productivity.
